     * - Take an integer number as input
     * - Classify the number as either even or odd
     * - Return "wizard" for even numbers
     * - Return "orc" for odd numbers

     * Think about: How do you determine if a number is even or odd? What mathematical operation can help?
     * This is a basic example of using conditional logic to categorize numbers.
