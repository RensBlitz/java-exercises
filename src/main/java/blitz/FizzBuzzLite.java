     * Generate a list following FizzBuzz rules.

     * This method should:
     * - Create a list of exactly 20 items
     * - Apply FizzBuzz rules:
     *   * For multiples of 3, use "Fizz"
     *   * For all other numbers, use the number as a string
     * - Return the formatted list
     * 
     * Think about: How do you check if a number is a multiple of 3? How do you convert numbers to strings?
     * This is a classic programming exercise that tests your understanding of loops and conditionals.
     * What happens when you reach the end of the list?
